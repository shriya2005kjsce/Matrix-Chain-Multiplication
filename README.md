ðŸ§® Matrix Chain Multiplication Visualizer
This little app helps you understand how the Matrix Chain Multiplication algorithm works â€” step by step. Itâ€™s built with Streamlit and is designed to walk you through the dynamic programming process in a simple and interactive way.

ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s This About?
If youâ€™ve ever studied dynamic programming, youâ€™ve probably come across this classic problem:
Given a sequence of matrices, whatâ€™s the most efficient way to multiply them?
Since matrix multiplication is associative, the order in which you perform the multiplication can drastically affect the total number of operations. The goal is to minimize the number of scalar multiplications.
This app lets you:
â€¢	Enter any set of matrix dimensions
â€¢	Watch the dynamic programming table fill up
â€¢	Understand exactly how and why each choice is made
â€¢	See the optimal multiplication order (with parentheses!)
Itâ€™s perfect for students, teachers, or anyone trying to get a clear idea of how this algorithm works.
